# This if-statement just checks if the current running Python file's file name is "__main__". The name of the
# current Python file is stored implicitly (by default) by Python in the __name__ variable. For the Python file
# that is directly executed however, this __name__ variable holds "__main__", regardless of what the file is called.
# This if-statement is commonly included in Python programs because it allows us to check if this file was executed
# directly (e.g. 'python main.py' in the terminal) or if it is being imported (when importing packages/modules, 
# the code inside them is read and executed by the Python interpreter). Without this if-statement, if this file was
# imported by other Python code files, the following lines would be executed and the app would be built and ran
# when we don't want it to be. Even if we never import this file anywhere else, it is good practice to have this
# conditional statement.
